## Chatbot with file managing
Chatbot with handling files and quick response
I build a chatbot using Basic NLP Technique.

1. File Info: Displays information about a specific file, such as its size and last modification time.
2. Search Files: Searches for files matching a specified keyword within the directory.
3. Rename File: Renames a file in the directory.
4. Copy File: Copies a file from one location to another within the directory.
5. Delete File: Deletes a specified file from the directory.
The main() function prompts the user for a directory path and then enters a loop to receive user commands. It processes each command and provides appropriate responses until the user exits.
